# Job Role Pay Disparity Analysis Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the Job Role Pay Disparity Analysis Project. In this endeavor, we aim to address and investigate the issue of pay disparities within the job market, with a specific focus on gender-based wage discrepancies. Our analysis will delve into the factors influencing base pay and how these factors interact with gender to influence compensation levels.

## Purpose

The core objectives of this project are as follows:

- **Exploration of Pay Disparities**: We intend to explore and analyze the base pay for a variety of job roles to identify and quantify pay disparities that may exist.
- **Gender-Based Wage Differences**: A primary focus will be on assessing the influence of gender on income, with the goal of understanding the depth and extent of the gender-based pay gap.
- **Factors Affecting Compensation**: We will investigate the impact of several other factors, including age, performance evaluations, education, department, seniority, and bonuses, on job role pay disparities.
- **Insights and Recommendations**: The project's ultimate aim is to provide insights into the data and generate meaningful recommendations to help address and mitigate pay disparities.

## Inspiration

The inspiration behind this project stems from the ongoing need to address and rectify the issue of gender-based wage disparities, particularly within the same job titles. There have been numerous studies highlighting this issue, and it is essential to contribute to the discussion and work towards equitable compensation for all.

We are excited to embark on this journey of data analysis and look forward to unveiling meaningful insights and recommendations for tackling pay disparities.

Stay tuned for further updates as we delve into the data and begin our analysis.
